# Full Stack E-Commerce

Welcome to the repository for my Full Stack E-Commerce project. This project is a comprehensive e-commerce solution with a fully functional dashboard and CMS, database management, payment system, and more.

## Features

- **Dashboard & CMS**: The project uses Next.js 13 App Router, React, Tailwind, and Headless UI to create a robust and user-friendly dashboard and CMS.

- **Database Management**: The project uses MySQL for database management, with Prisma as the ORM. I also use PlanetScale for database scaling.

- **Payments**: The project integrates Stripe for payments. The checkout is fully functional. For demo purposes, you can use [Stripe Testing Cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

- **Authentication**: I use Clerk for user authentication.

- **State Management**: Zustand is used for state management.

- **Deployment**: The project is deployed on Vercel.

## Admin Dashboard
